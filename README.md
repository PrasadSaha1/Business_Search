Hello there! I'm Prasad Saha, and this is my submission for NYS FBLA Coding & Progamming 2026. 
<br> Here is a link to the deployed website: https://business-search-frontend.onrender.com/

<b>Notes</b> 
<br> The app is currently called LocalBizExplorer, but originally, it was BusinessSearch. This is reflected in some areas (ie. website URL)
